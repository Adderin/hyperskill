I decided to once again see how I know Core Java and check the hyperskill.org resource
However, I forgot to initialize the readme, so some problems will be omitted.

**Wave 1**
**Branching statements â†’ The sequence**

`Write a program that prints a part of the sequence 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 ... 
(the number is repeated as many times, to what it equals to). 
The input to the program is a positive integer n: the number of the elements 
of the sequence the program should print. Output the sequence of numbers, written in a single line, space-separated.

For example, if n = 7, then the program should output 1 2 2 3 3 3 4.`

**Sample Input 1:**
7

**Sample Output 1:**
1 2 2 3 3 3 4
