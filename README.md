I decided to once again see how I know Core Java and check the hyperskill.org resource
However, I forgot to initialize the readme, so some problems will be omitted.

## **Wave 1**

#### **Branching statements → Bus tour**
>A bus tour of Europe has been very successful. Due to an increase in the number of people that want to go on a tour, the tour company decided to increase the height of the bus. The new height of the bus is exactly N centimeters.
But the tour’s route runs under a lot of bridges, and there is a chance that the bus will crash into one of these bridges. Can you find out if this will happen?
The first line of the input contains the height of the bus and number of bridges under which the bus passes. The second line contains heights of these bridges.
>
>You should output "Will not crash" if everything will be all right; otherwise, output "Will crash on bridge i" (where i is a number of a bridge) into which the bus will crash. If the height of a bridge equals the height of the bus, the bus will crash.

Will not crash

>Sample Output 2: 
Will crash on bridge 2

#### **Branching statements → The sequence**

>Write a program that prints a part of the sequence 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 ... 
>(the number is repeated as many times, to what it equals to). 
>The input to the program is a positive integer n: the number of the elements 
>of the sequence the program should print. Output the sequence of numbers, written in a single line, space-separated.
>
>For example, if n = 7, then the program should output 1 2 2 3 3 3 4.
>
>**Sample Input 1:**
> 7

>**Sample Output 1:**
> 1 2 2 3 3 3 4
